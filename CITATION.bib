  abstract = {
    We present egglog, a fixpoint reasoning system that unifies Datalog and equality saturation (EqSat). 
    Like Datalog, egglog supports efficient incremental execution, cooperating analyses, and lattice-based reasoning. 
    Like EqSat, egglog supports term rewriting, efficient congruence closure, and extraction of optimized terms. 
    We identify two recent applications -- a unification-based pointer analysis in Datalog and an EqSat-based floating-point term rewriter -- 
    that have been hampered by features missing from Datalog but found in EqSat or vice-versa. 
    We evaluate our system by reimplementing those projects in egglog. 
    The resulting systems in egglog are faster, simpler, and fix bugs found in the original systems.
